# DLCG-fish-classifier
Part3 of our project for Deep Learning Computer Graphics at UF. This project aims to identify and classify invasive fish species using transfer learning.

## Instructions for virtual environment
- in order to manage dependencies we can use the part3 venv which makes sure all packages are the same version and auto included.
- to use it type `source part3/bin/activate` while in the DLCG-Fish-Classifier directory. (for unix)
  - I think that for windows `part3/Scripts/activate.bat` will work not sure
